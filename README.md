## Quick start

To get started you will need to install the requirements to run the Digital Connector. 

This tutorial will guide you to a quick start on Mac OS X. Tutorials to guide you through other operating systems will come soon.

<span style="color:red"> **Note: youâ€™ll need to have administrator rights on your machine to install this - 
make sure that you do before you proceed.**
</span>

### Requirements

**Install the following**via the link through to their installation page: 

* [Java Development Kit (1.8+)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [PostgreSQL (9.4+)](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostGIS (2.1+)](http://postgis.net/)
* [Gradle (2.12+)](https://gradle.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

#### A note about the Terminal

The [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) application can be found in the Applications -> Utilities folder or quickly accessed through 
Spotlight. It is pre-installed in the MacOS X so there is no need to install it. 

You will need this application to run some of the commands of this tutorial. When you enter a command and press 
return/enter, the terminal will execute it and complete the task.

**Make sure to press return after typing a command before you enter the next one.**

#### Let's start

* Open the **Terminal**. All the following steps will operate in it.

* Check if you have installed the right versions for the requirements by entering each of the following commands in 
the Terminal.

 ```bash
java -version
psql --version
gradle --version
git --version
```

The output will look something like this:
```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_121"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)
$ psql --version
psql (PostgreSQL) 9.6.3
$ gradle --version

Gradle 3.4

Groovy:       2.4.7
Ant:          Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.6 compiled on June 29 2015
JVM:          1.8.0_121 (Oracle Corporation 25.121-b13)

$ git --version
git version 2.10.1 (Apple Git-78)
```

* Get the Digital Connector code to your local machine by cloning its repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FutureCitiesCatapult/TomboloDigitalConnector
```

If successful, it will look like this.

```bash
$git clone https://github.com/FutureCitiesCatapult/TomboloDigitalConnector  
Cloning into 'TomboloDigitalConnector'...
remote: Counting objects: 15761, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (184/184), done.

```

* Go to the Digital Connetor root directory and rename the properties files. These can be done you running each of the
following commands and pressing enter.

```bash
cd TomboloDigitalConnector
mv gradle.properties.example gradle.properties
mv apikeys.properties.example apikeys.properties
```

The previous commands will allow you to use the default project settings.  

*If you prefer/need you can amend the settings altering the default ones to the ones you decide.*


### Set up database

The following step sets up a main and a test database after starting the server.
The test database is used by the tests and is cleared routinely. We use this to gain control over what is in the 
database when our tests are running and to avoid affecting any important data in your main database.

```bash
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
chmod +x create_db.sh
./create_db.sh
```

*For more information or to change the default database and user settings access the file [create_db.sh](create_db.sh).*

### Run tests 

A quick check on how everything has been set up is to run all the tests. If they are successful, it will mean that 
everything went fine.

Run the command in the Terminal.

```bash
gradle test
```

If successful the output will be as the following.
```bash
$ gradle test
:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes UP-TO-DATE
:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
:processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
> Building 85% > :test > 50 tests completed
:test

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 4 mins 50.919 secs
```

**If the tests start to fail then check the PostgreSQL server is running and the requirements are properly installed by
 going through the previous steps.**
 
The following means that the server is not running. 
```bash
uk.org.tombolo.core.AttributeTest > testUniqueLabel FAILED
    java.util.ServiceConfigurationError
        Caused by: org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceException
            Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException
                Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException
                    Caused by: java.net.ConnectException

uk.org.tombolo.core.AttributeTest > testWriteJSON FAILED
    java.util.ServiceConfigurationError
        Caused by: org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceException
            Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException
                Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException
                    Caused by: java.net.ConnectException

uk.org.tombolo.core.DatasourceTest > testWriteJSON FAILED
    java.util.ServiceConfigurationError
        Caused by: org.hibernate.service.spi.ServiceException
            Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException
                Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException
                    Caused by: java.net.ConnectException
```

and to solve it you need to run the command
```bash
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
```


In case you see this error, it means that you did not rename the settings files successfully.
```bash
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/TomboloDigitalConnector/build.gradle' line: 159

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':test'.
> Test environment not configured. See the README.
```

If you see other errors, try to go back and follow the steps again.


###Run the Digital Connector

Now you are all set to run a task on the Digital Connector. 


... to be continued


### Run tests

```bash
gradle test
```

If you use the IntelliJ JUnit test runner, you will need to add the following to your
VM Options in your JUnit configuration (Run -> Edit Configurations -> All under JUnit,
and Defaults -> JUnit):

```
-enableassertions
-disableassertions:org.geotools...
-Denvironment=test
-DdatabaseURI=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/tombolo_test
-DdatabaseUsername=tombolo_test
-DdatabasePassword=tombolo_test
```

## Local deploy

To deploy to your local Maven installation (`~/.m2` by default):

```
gradle install
```

## Run Tasks

### Run export

We use the Gradle task `runExport` to run exports. The parameters are as follows:

```bash
gradle runExport \
    -PdataExportSpecFile='path/to/spec/file.json' \
    -PoutputFile='output_file.json' \
    -PforceImports='com.className'
    -PclearDatabaseCache=true
```

For example, this calculates the proportion of cycle traffic received at a traffic counter relative to the total traffic
in a given borough and outputs the results to the file `reaggregate-traffic-count-to-la.json`:

```bash
gradle runExport \
    -PdataExportSpecFile='src/main/resources/executions/examples/reaggregate-traffic-count-to-la.json' \
    -PoutputFile='reaggregate-traffic-count-to-la_output.json'
```

### Export data catalogue

We use the Gradle task `exportCatalogue` to export a JSON file detailing the capabilities of the connector
and explore the data catalogue.

```bash
gradle exportCatalogue -PoutputFile=catalogue.json
```

## Continuous Integration

We're using [Wercker](http://wercker.com/) for CI. Commits and PRs will be run
against the CI server automatically. If you don't have access, you can use the
Wercker account in the 1Password Servers vault to add yourself.

If you need to run the CI environment locally:

1. Install the [Wercker CLI](http://wercker.com/cli/install)
2. Run `wercker build`

The base image is generated with the very simple Dockerfile in the root of this
project. To push a new image to DockerHub you will need access to our DockerHub
account. If you don't have access, you can use the DockerHub account in the
1Password Servers vault to add yourself.

If you need new versions of PostgreSQL, Java, etc, you can update the image:

```
docker build -t tombolo .
docker images
# Look for `tombolo` and note the IMAGE ID
docker tag <IMAGE_ID> fcclab/tombolo:latest
docker push fcclab/tombolo
```

## Wiki to PDF

To create a PDF version of the Wiki documentation clone the wiki respository 
and run the gradel build in the wiki repository root folder.

```
gradle build
```
