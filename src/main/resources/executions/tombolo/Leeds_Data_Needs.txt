#Ideal data for use in LEEDS use case version 0.1

- I have identified dataset id where possible. Where I haven't provided ID's i'm not sure if there's API access
(there probably is and i'm just missing it).

- Realistically we take the data in whatever form it comes / whatever is easiest from the connector / easiest for you.

Ideally:

- Datasets with an id of "QS...." would come in the form of CSV files where Each LSOA ID
is a row and each row in the original "QS...." datasets is a column with the column header being the row
name in the "QS...." dataset. This is probably unrealistic and a lot easier to do in R than the connector.
Thus separate CSV files for each LSOA would be great. We can talk about this if it is unclear.

- Datasets such as the LSOA would come as shapefiles if possible or GeoJSON if preferred.

- The NPTDR, NHS and population projections as CSV would be great.
